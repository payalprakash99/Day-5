 Why use a graph over a relational DB or other NoSQL?


- Very simple compared to RDBMS, and much more flexible
- The real power is in relationship-focused data (most NoSQL dbs don't treat relationships as first-order)
- As relations and amount of data increases, so does advantage of Graph DBs




Neo4j
  ->Neo4j is an open-source, NoSQL, native graph database
  ->The source code, written in Java and Scala,
  ->Neo4j has both a Community Edition and Enterprise Edition of the database.
  ->Neo4j is referred to as a native graph database because it efficiently implements the property graph model down to the storage level. 
  ->Cypher, a declarative query language similar to SQL, but optimized for graphs. Now used by other databases like SAP HANA Graph and Redis graph
